##Hello, my blog!
WOW! I cannot believe I just build my self a blog that totally belongs to me. I have been thinking about building up my blog for since my junior year, and it is here finally! Putting my excitement aside, I really hope this blog could grow as much as it can!

##Contents planned
After my graduation from UMass, I have been reviewing all the stuff I have learned, including OS, computer networking, network security, algorithm, etc. I have been working my ass off to get a job offer(which I did!). I have been doing all kinds of challenging questions on leetcode. <br>
Then I find that I actually have taken a lot of notes, and they have been so helpful. So I think to myself, why not review them by writing them into your personal blog? That just sound so badass to me! It helps me, and hopefully helps you!<br>
So right now, as a CS fresh grad, here are some content I planned for my blog: 
- LeetCode questions(only the fun one!)
- Commands for git, npm, emacs, etc
- Technical stuff like web programming
- Small but tricky problems I encoutered
- ......more to come
Maybe these stuff could be found by just searching on Google, and there could be some much better source for all kinds of material..... But who cares? I am also here to share!

##Conclusion
I hope this blog could help me enhance the skills I am learning or learned, and that would be great if it could help you guys!
