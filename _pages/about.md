excerpt: Acidently, you just found me
---

Oh god, you just found another boring and naive computer science fresh graduate.

Welp, yeah. Since you are here, why not learn a little bit of me?

I am Yijuan Zhi, or you can call me Xavier. My Chinese friends like to call me Xman, and I think the reason behind it is because they usually cannot pronunce 'Xa' correctly. So sometimes, I tell people my name is Zac. I am somewhat fine with two names loool.

I am from a busy city in the South of China. When people hear where I am from, they are always like "Dang, you must be rich!". Welp, unluckily, I am not another spoiled Chinese kid you have see. I work hard(and play hard), and desperately want to live like a dream(I wiil come for you Dodge Challenger).

I used to be an architecture student in Tamkung University which is located in Tamsui, Taiwan, where I found computer science is actually what I love. 

Jobs and work aside, I love playing games on Nintendo Switch. I used to play really hard in League of Legend, and get pretty high in rank. But if you want to play with me now, don't expect to win. I just love trolling, that is the only fun part of this game, right? I smoke a little bit, which I like to call it as "functional smoke". I play sports, and used to be a member in local swimming competition team. 

Welp, that is just a piece of myself. If you want to learn some material I have learned, feel free to go through my blog. If you want to play game with me, send me an email. 

It's been nice to have you here, and good luck to you all.
