### Yijuan Zhi's Blog

Wow, you just found the source code of my blog website.

The blog is built intended to share some stuff I am learning or learned, and potentially a showcase of myself.

But don't worry, here is a little bit about how I built it.

It is built with [Minimal-Mistake Jekyll theme.](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/). It is open source and totally free. So feel free to go through the website and documents, and pull it into your github so that you can build one for your own!
