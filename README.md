### Yijuan Zhi's Blog

Wow, you just found the source code of my blog.

The blog is built intended to share some stuff I am learning or learned, and potentially a showcase of myself.

Here is a little bit about how I built it.

It is built with [Minimal-Mistake Jekyll theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/). It is open source and totally free. So feel free to go through the website and documentation, and fork it into your github so that you can build one for your own. 

If you encounter some problems while building, I have written a blog "Problems I encountered while building blog with Minimal Mistake Jekyll theme", please feel free to go through it if you have the same problem as me.
